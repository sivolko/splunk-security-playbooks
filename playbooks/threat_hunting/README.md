# Threat Hunting Playbook

## Description

This playbook automates threat hunting activities to proactively search for indicators of compromise (IOCs) in your environment. It queries a number of internal security technologies to determine if any artifacts present in your data sources have been observed in your environment. This helps security teams identify potential threats that might not have been detected by traditional security tools.

## Playbook Type
Detection and Investigation

## Playbook Workflow

The playbook follows this general workflow:

1. Ingest threat intelligence indicators from various sources
2. Query internal security systems for matches
3. Analyze results to identify potential compromises
4. Investigate affected systems in detail
5. Document findings and initiate response if threats are confirmed

## Implementation Requirements

- Splunk SOAR with appropriate integrations
- Threat intelligence feeds (CSV or API-based)
- Access to internal security technologies:
  - EDR/EPP solutions
  - SIEM
  - Network monitoring tools
  - DNS logs
  - Email security
  - Web proxies

## Dataflow Diagram

Below is the detailed dataflow of the playbook's execution. See the `dataflow_diagram.md` file for a visual representation.

## Implementation Steps

1. Configure Splunk SOAR to ingest threat intelligence feeds
2. Set up integrations with internal security technologies
3. Define hunting criteria and thresholds
4. Customize response actions based on findings

## Code Overview

The playbook code handles:
- Loading and parsing threat intelligence indicators
- Querying multiple internal systems for indicator matches
- Correlation of findings across different security technologies
- Detailed analysis of potentially compromised systems
- Automated evidence collection for affected systems
- Documentation and reporting capabilities
- Integration with incident response workflows
