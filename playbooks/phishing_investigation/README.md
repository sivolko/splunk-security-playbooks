# Phishing Investigation and Response Playbook

## Description

This playbook automates the investigation and response to phishing email threats. It accelerates the analysis process, retrieves threat intelligence on URLs, domains, and attachments, and provides standardized response actions. This helps security teams reduce the time spent on phishing investigations from an average of 90 minutes to as little as 60 seconds per alert.

## Playbook Type
Investigation and Response

## Playbook Workflow

The playbook follows this general workflow:

1. Trigger on reported phishing email
2. Parse email content and extract potential indicators
3. Analyze email headers, URLs, and attachments
4. Perform threat intelligence enrichment on extracted indicators
5. Determine threat level and appropriate response
6. Implement response actions (blocking, quarantine, etc.)
7. Update incident documentation and notify stakeholders

## Implementation Requirements

- Splunk SOAR with email processing capabilities
- Integration with threat intelligence services
- Integration with email security gateway
- Integration with firewall/web proxy (for URL/domain blocking)
- Integration with endpoint security tools (for malware response)

## Dataflow Diagram

Below is the detailed dataflow of the playbook's execution. See the `dataflow_diagram.md` file for a visual representation.

## Implementation Steps

1. Configure Splunk SOAR to ingest phishing reports/alerts
2. Set up integrations with required security tools and services
3. Customize response actions based on your organization's security policies
4. Implement notification workflows for security team and end users

## Code Overview

The playbook code handles:
- Email parsing and indicator extraction
- Threat intelligence lookups for URLs, domains, IPs, and file hashes
- Reputation scoring and risk assessment
- Automated response actions:
  - URL/domain blocking
  - Attachment sandboxing and analysis
  - Email quarantine and removal
  - Similar email search and quarantine
- Notification and documentation processes
